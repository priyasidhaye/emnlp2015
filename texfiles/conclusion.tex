\section{Conclusion}
We have described a study on investigating whether indicative tweet generation can be viewed as an extractive summarization problem. By analyzing a collection of indicative tweets that we collected according to measures inspired by extractive summarization evaluation measures, we 
find that most tweets cannot be recovered from the article that they link to, demonstrating a limit to the effectiveness of extractive methods.

We further performed an analysis to determine the role of formality differences between the source article and the Twitter genre. We find evidence that formality is an important factor, as the less formal the source article is, the less extractive the tweets seem to be. Future methods that can change the level of formality of a piece of text without changing the contents will be needed, as will those that explicitly consider the intended use of the tweet.
